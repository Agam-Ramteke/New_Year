Another year has come and gone, but one thing remains my favorite constant: you. You bring so much light, laughter, and warmth into my world.

As we step into 2026, I just want to remind you how incredibly special you are to me. Here's to more shared moments, more smiles, and a year that's as amazing as you are.

Happy New Year! 🎆

— With all my love, Agam`,
